Ferrari
-------

Model an application which contains a **class Ferrari** and an **interface**.
Your task is simple, you have a **car - Ferrari**, its model is **"488-Spider"**
and it has a **driver**. Your Ferrari should have functionality to **use
brakes** and **push the gas pedal**. When the **brakes** are pushed down **print
"Brakes!"**, and when the **gas pedal** is pushed down - **"Zadu6avam sA!"**. As
you may have guessed this functionality is typical for all cars, so you should
**implement an interface** to describe it.

Your task is to **create a Ferrari** and **set the driver's name** to the passed
one in the input. After that, print the info. Take a look at the Examples to
understand the task better.

### Input

On the **single input line**, you will be given the **driver's name**.

### Output

On the **single output line**, print the model, the messages from the brakes and
gas pedal methods and the driver's name. In the following format:

\<**model**\>/\<**brakes**\>/\<**gas pedal**\>/\<**driver's name**\>

### Constraints

The input will always be valid, no need to check it explicitly! The Driver's
name may contain any ASCII characters.

### Example

| **Input**  | **Output**                                  |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Bat Giorgi | 488-Spider/Brakes!/Zadu6avam sA!/Bat Giorgi |
| Dinko      | 488-Spider/Brakes!/Zadu6avam sA!/Dinko      |
