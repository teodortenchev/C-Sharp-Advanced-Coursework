Exercises: Interfaces and Abstraction
=====================================

This document defines the **exercise assignments** for the ["C\# OOP Basics"
course \@ Software
University](https://softuni.bg/trainings/2084/csharp-oop-basics-october-2018).

Please submit your solutions (source code) of all below described problems in
[Judge](https://judge.softuni.bg/Contests/245/Interfaces-and-Abstraction-Exercise).

Define an Interface IPerson
---------------------------

**NOTE**: You need a public **StartUp** class with the namespace **PersonInfo**.

Define an interface **IPerson** with properties for **Name** and **Age**. Define
a class **Citizen** which implements **IPerson** and has a constructor which
takes a **string** name and an **int** age.

Try to create a new Person like this:

| string name = Console.ReadLine(); int age = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine()); IPerson person = new Citizen(name, age); Console.WriteLine(person.Name); Console.WriteLine(person.Age); |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|


### Examples

| **Input** | **Output** |
|-----------|------------|
| Pesho 25  | Pesho 25   |

Multiple Implementation
-----------------------

**NOTE**: You need a public **StartUp** class with the namespace **PersonInfo**.

Using the code from the previous task, define an interface **IIdentifiable**
with a **string** property **Id** and an interface **IBirthable** with a
**string** property **Birthdate** and implement them in the **Citizen** class.
Rewrite the Citizen constructor to accept the new parameters.

Test your class like this:

| string name = Console.ReadLine(); int age = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine()); string id = Console.ReadLine(); string birthdate = Console.ReadLine(); IIdentifiable identifiable = new Citizen(name, age,id, birthdate); IBirthable birthable = new Citizen(name, age, id, birthdate); Console.WriteLine(identifiable.Id); Console.WriteLine(birthable.Birthdate); |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|


### Examples

| **Input**                      | **Output**            |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Pesho 25 9105152287 15/05/1991 | 9105152287 15/05/1991 |

Ferrari
-------

Model an application which contains a **class Ferrari** and an **interface**.
Your task is simple, you have a **car - Ferrari**, its model is **"488-Spider"**
and it has a **driver**. Your Ferrari should have functionality to **use
brakes** and **push the gas pedal**. When the **brakes** are pushed down **print
"Brakes!"**, and when the **gas pedal** is pushed down - **"Zadu6avam sA!"**. As
you may have guessed this functionality is typical for all cars, so you should
**implement an interface** to describe it.

Your task is to **create a Ferrari** and **set the driver's name** to the passed
one in the input. After that, print the info. Take a look at the Examples to
understand the task better.

### Input

On the **single input line**, you will be given the **driver's name**.

### Output

On the **single output line**, print the model, the messages from the brakes and
gas pedal methods and the driver's name. In the following format:

\<**model**\>/\<**brakes**\>/\<**gas pedal**\>/\<**driver's name**\>

### Constraints

The input will always be valid, no need to check it explicitly! The Driver's
name may contain any ASCII characters.

### Example

| **Input**  | **Output**                                  |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Bat Giorgi | 488-Spider/Brakes!/Zadu6avam sA!/Bat Giorgi |
| Dinko      | 488-Spider/Brakes!/Zadu6avam sA!/Dinko      |

Telephony
---------

You have a business - **manufacturing cell phones**. But you have no software
developers, so you call some friends of yours and ask them to help you create a
cell phone software. They have already agreed and you started working on the
project. The project consists of one main **model – a Smartphone**. Each of your
smartphones should have functionalities of **calling other phones** and
**browsing in the world wide web.**

These friends of yours though are very busy, so you decide to write the code on
your own. Here is the mandatory assignment:

You should have a **model** - **Smartphone** and two separate functionalities
which your smartphone has - to **call other phones** and to **browse in the
world wide web**. You should end up with **one class** and **two interfaces**.

### Input

The input comes from the console. It will hold two lines:

-   **First line**: **phone numbers** to call (string), separated by spaces.

-   **Second line: sites** to visit (string), separated by spaces.

### Output

-   First **call all numbers** in the order of input then **browse all sites**
    in order of input

-   The functionality of calling phones is printing on the console the number
    which are being called in the format:

>   **Calling... \<number\>**

-   The functionality of the browser should print on the console the site in
    format:

>   **Browsing: \<site\>!**

-   If there is a number in the input of the URLs, print: **"Invalid URL!"** and
    continue printing the rest of the URLs.

-   If there is a character different from a digit in a number, print:
    **"Invalid number!"** and continue to the next number.

### Constraints

-   Each site's URL should consist only of letters and symbols (**No digits are
    allowed** in the URL address)

### Examples

| **Input**                                                                                                   | **Output**                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Border Control
--------------

It’s the future, you’re the ruler of a totalitarian dystopian society inhabited
by **citizens** and **robots**, since you’re afraid of rebellions you decide to
implement strict control of who enters your city. Your soldiers check the
**Id**s of everyone who enters and leaves.

You will receive an unknown amount of lines from the console until the command
“**End**” is received, on each line there will be a piece of information for
either a citizen or a robot who tries to enter your city in the format
**“\<name\> \<age\> \<id\>**” for **citizens** and “**\<model\> \<id\>**” for
**robots**. After the end command on the next line you will receive a single
number representing **the last digits of fake ids**, all citizens or robots
whose **Id** ends with the specified digits must be detained.

The output of your program should consist of all detained **Id**s each on a
separate line in the **order** of **input**.

### Input

The input comes from the console. Every commands’ parameters before the command
“**End**” will be separated by a **single space**.

### Examples

| **Input**                                                                                            | **Output**          |

Birthday Celebrations
---------------------

It is a well known fact that people celebrate birthdays, it is also known that
some people also celebrate their pets’ birthdays. Extend the program from your
last task to add **birthdates** to citizens and include a class **Pet**, pets
have a **name** and a **birthdate**. Encompass repeated functionality into
interfaces and implement them in your classes.

You will receive from the console an unknown amount of lines. Until the command
“**End**” is received, each line will contain information in one of the
following formats **“Citizen \<name\> \<age\> \<id\> \<birthdate\>**” for
citizens, “**Robot \<model\> \<id\>**” for robots or “**Pet \<name\>
\<birthdate\>**” for pets. After the “**End**” command on the next line you will
receive a single number representing **a specific year**, your task is to print
all birthdates (of both citizens and pets) in that year in the format
**day/month/year** in the **order** of **input**.

### Examples

| **Input**                                                                                                                              | **Output**            |

Food Shortage
-------------

Your totalitarian dystopian society suffers a shortage of food, so many rebels
appear. Extend the code from your previous task with new functionality to solve
this task.

Define a class **Rebel** which has a **name**, **age** and **group**
(string)**,** names are **unique -** there will never be 2 Rebels/Citizens or a
Rebel and Citizen with the same name**.** Define an interface **IBuyer** which
defines a method **BuyFood()** and an integer property **Food**. Implement the
**IBuyer** interface in the **Citizen** and **Rebel** class, both Rebels and
Citizens **start with 0 food**, when a Rebel buys food his **Food** increases by
**5**, when a Citizen buys food his **Food** increases by **10**.

On the first line of the input you will receive an integer **N** - the number of
people, on each of the next **N** lines you will receive information in one of
the following formats “**\<name\> \<age\> \<id\> \<birthdate\>**” for a Citizen
or “**\<name\> \<age\>\<group\>**” for a Rebel. After the **N** lines until the
command “**End**” is received, you will receive names of people who bought food,
each on a new line. Note that not all names may be valid, in case of an
incorrect name - nothing should happen.

### Output

The **output** consists of only **one line** on which you should print the
**total** amount of food purchased.

### Examples

| **Input**                                                                                                                                     | **Output** |

Military Elite
--------------

Create the following class hierarchy:

-   **Soldier** – general class for soldiers, holding **id**, **first name** and
    **last name.**

    -   **Private** – lowest base soldier type, holding the field
        **salary**(decimal).

        -   **LieutenantGeneral** – holds a set of **Privates** under his
            command.

        -   **SpecialisedSoldier –** general class for all specialised soldiers
            – holds the **corps** of the soldier. The corps can only be one of
            the following: **Airforces** or **Marines**.

            -   **Engineer** – holds a set of **repairs**. A **repair** holds a
                **part name** and **hours worked**(int).

            -   **Commando** – holds a set of **missions**. A mission holds
                **code name** and a **state** (*inProgress* or *Finished*). A
                mission can be finished through the method
                **CompleteMission()**.

    -   **Spy** – holds the **code number** of the spy (int).

Extract **interfaces** for each class. (e.g. **ISoldier**, **IPrivate**,
**ILieutenantGeneral**, etc.) The interfaces should hold their public properties
and methods (e.g. **Isoldier** should hold **id**, **first name** and **last
name**). Each class should implement its respective interface. Validate the
input where necessary (corps, mission state) - input should match **exactly**
one of the required values, otherwise it should be treated as **invalid**. In
case of **invalid corps** the entire line should be skipped, in case of an
**invalid mission state** only the mission should be skipped.

You will receive from the console an unknown amount of lines containing
information about soldiers until the command “**End**” is received. The
information will be in one of the following formats:

-   Private: “**Private \<id\> \<firstName\> \<lastName\> \<salary\>**”

-   LeutenantGeneral: “**LieutenantGeneral \<id\> \<firstName\> \<lastName\>
    \<salary\> \<private1Id\> \<private2Id\> … \<privateNId\>**” where
    privateXId will **always** be an **Id** of a private already received
    through the input.

-   Engineer: “**Engineer \<id\> \<firstName\> \<lastName\> \<salary\> \<corps\>
    \<repair1Part\> \<repair1Hours\> … \<repairNPart\> \<repairNHours\>**” where
    repairXPart is the name of a repaired part and repairXHours the hours it
    took to repair it (the two parameters will always come paired).

-   Commando: “**Commando \<id\> \<firstName\> \<lastName\> \<salary\> \<corps\>
    \<mission1CodeName\> \<mission1state\> … \<missionNCodeName\>
    \<missionNstate\>**” a missions cde name, description and state will always
    come together.

-   Spy: “**Spy \<id\> \<firstName\> \<lastName\> \<codeNumber\>**”

Define proper constructors. Avoid code duplication through abstraction. Override
**ToString()** in all classes to print detailed information about the object.

-   **Privates:**  
    **Name: \<firstName\> \<lastName\> Id: \<id\> Salary: \<salary\>**

-   **Spy:**  
    **Name: \<firstName\> \<lastName\> Id: \<id\>**  
    **Code Number: \<codeNumber\>**

-   **LieutenantGeneral:**  
    **Name: \<firstName\> \<lastName\> Id: \<id\> Salary: \<salary\>**  
    **Privates:**  
    **\<private1 ToString()\>**  
    **\<private2 ToString()\>**  
    **…**  
    **\<privateN ToString()\>**

-   **Engineer:**  
    **Name: \<firstName\> \<lastName\> Id: \<id\> Salary: \<salary\>**  
    **Corps: \<corps\>**  
    **Repairs:**  
    **\<repair1 ToString()\>**  
    **\<repair2 ToString()\>**  
    **…**  
    **\<repairN ToString()\>**

-   **Commando:**  
    **Name: \<firstName\> \<lastName\> Id: \<id\> Salary: \<salary\>**  
    **Corps: \<corps\>**  
    **Missions:**  
    **\<mission1 ToString()\>**  
    **\<mission2 ToString()\>**  
    **…**  
    **\<missionN ToString()\>**

-   **Repair:**  
    **Part Name: \<partName\> Hours Worked: \<hoursWorked\>**

-   **Mission:**  
    **Code Name: \<codeName\> State: \<state\>**

**NOTE:** Salary should be printed rounded to **two decimal places** after the
separator.

\*Collection Hierarchy
----------------------

Create 3 different string collections – **AddCollection**,
**AddRemoveCollection** and **MyList**.

The **AddCollection** should have:

-   Only a single method **Add** which adds an item to the **end** of the
    collection.

The **AddRemoveCollection** should have:

-   An **Add** method – which adds an item to the **start** of the collection.

-   A **Remove** method which removes the **last** item in the collection.

The **MyList** collection should have:

-   An **Add** method which adds an item to the **start** of the collection.

-   A **Remove** method which removes the **first** element in the collection.

-   A **Used** property which displays the number of elements currently in the
    collection.

Create interfaces which define the collections functionality, think how to model
the relations between interfaces to reuse code. Add an extra bit of
functionality to the methods in the custom collections, **add** methods should
return the index in which the item was added, **remove** methods should return
the item that was removed.

Your task is to create a single copy of your collections, after which on the
first input line you will receive a random amount of strings in a single line
separated by spaces - the elements you must add to each of your collections. For
each of your collections write a single line in the output that holds the
results of all **Add operations** separated by spaces (check the examples to
better understand the format). On the second input line, you will receive a
single number - the amount of **Remove operations** you have to call on each
collection. In the same manner, as with the Add operations for each collection
(except the AddCollection), print a line with the results of each Remove
operation separated by spaces.

### Input

The input comes from the console. It will hold two lines:

-   The first line will contain a random amount of strings separated by spaces -
    the elements you have to **Add** to each of your collections.

-   The second line will contain a single number - the amount of **Remove**
    operations.

### Output

The output will consist of 5 lines:

-   The first line contains the results of all **Add** operations on the
    **AddCollection** separated by spaces.

-   The second line contains the results of all **Add** operations on the
    **AddRemoveCollection** separated by spaces.

-   The third line contains the result of all **Add** operations on the
    **MyList** collection separated by spaces.

-   The fourth line contains the result of all **Remove** operations on the
    **AddRemoveCollection** separated by spaces.

-   The fifth line contains the result of all **Remove** operations on the
    **MyList** collection separated by spaces.

### Constraints

-   All collections should have a **length of 100.**

-   There will never be **more than 100** add operations.

-   The number of remove operations will never be more than the amount of add

### Hint

Create an interface hierarchy representing the collections. You can use a List
as the underlying collection and implement the methods using the List’s Add,
Remove and Insert methods.

\*Explicit Interfaces
---------------------

Create 2 interfaces **IResident** and **IPerson**. **IResident** should have a
**name**, **country** and a method **GetName()**. **IPerson** should have a
**name**, an **age** and a method **GetName()**. Create a class Citizen which
implements both **IResident** and **IPerson**, explicitly declare that
IResident’s **GetName()** method should return “Mr/Ms/Mrs ” before the name
while IPerson’s **GetName()** method should return just the name. You will
receive lines of citizen information from the console until the command
“**End**” is received. Each will be in the format **“\<name\> \<country\>
\<age\>**” for each line create the corresponding citizen and print his
**IPerson’s GetName()** and his **IResitent’s GetName().**
