Generic Count Method Strings
----------------------------

Create a **method** that receives as an argument a **list of any type that can
be compared** and an **element of the given type**. The method should **return
the count of the elements that are greater than the value of the given
element**. **Modify your Box class** to support **comparison by value** of the
stored data.

On the first line, you will receive **n** - the number of elements to add to the
list. On the next **n** lines, you will receive the actual elements. On the last
line, you will get the value of the element to which you need to compare every
element in the list.

### Examples

| **Input**      | **Output** |
|----------------|------------|
| 3 aa aaa bb aa | 2          |
