Generic Swap Method Strings
---------------------------

Create a generic method that receives a list, containing any type of data and
swaps the elements at two given indexes.

As in the previous problems read **n** number of boxes of type String and add
them to the list. On the next line, however you will receive a swap command
consisting of two indexes. Use the method you've created to swap the elements
that correspond to the given indexes and print each element in the list.

### Examples
