Generic Box of String
---------------------

Create a generic class **Box** that can be initialized with any type and store
the value. Override **ToString()** method method and print the type and stored
value in format {class full name: value}. On the first line, you will get **n**
- the number of strings to read from the console. On the next **n** lines, you
will get the actual strings. For each of them create a box and call its
**ToString()** method to print its data on the console.
